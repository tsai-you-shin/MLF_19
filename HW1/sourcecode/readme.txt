# ML HW1
## Date: 2019.10.29

## About: Implement the PLA and Pocket Algorithm in HW1 by python

## FILE
	- P_6.py
		Do the PLA algorithm 1126 times.
		Find out the average number of updates before the algorithm halts.
		Plot a histogram to show the number of updates versus the frequency of the number.

	- P_7.py
		Do the PLA + Pocket algorithm 1126 times.
		Find out the average error rate on the test data.
		Plot a histogram to show the error rate versus its frequency.

	- P_8.py
		Do the PLA algorithm 1126 times, each time only 100 updates.
		Find out the average error rate on the test data.
		Plot a histogram to show the error rate versus its frequency.

## EXECUTION
	$ python P_6.py

	- random

## NOTICE
	- The path of the input data is fixed. if ypu want to run the program prefectly, please check the path before you run.
	- There are some functions that will be used by many programs. For convenience and independence of the program, I directly copy these functions to other programs.
