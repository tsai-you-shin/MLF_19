# ML HW3
## DATE 2020.01.09

## About: Implement fixed rate descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithms in HW3.
		  And draw out the line charts about E_in, E_out of different algorithm.

## FILE - P_78.py
	
	- Since problem 7 and 8 use mostly the same computation result to plot figures,
	  I put the code of two problems together.
	  
	- The program will generate two .png images, which are the line chart of E_in and E_out, respectively.


## EXECUTION
	$ python3 P_78.py
	
## ENVIROMENT - python3
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	
## NOTICE
	(NONE)
